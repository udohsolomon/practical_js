### Practical Javascript
==========================

###### Here is where I will keep all of my work for the Practical Javascript course.
---
* It is a free beginner JS course taught by [Gordon Zhu](https://twitter.com/gordon_zhu)

* You can find it here: [www.watchandcode.com](https://watchandcode.com/])

* The main goal is to slowly create a todo list app which will continue to get more and more complex as we progress.
